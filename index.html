       <h2>Some facts about the legend</h2><br>
       <p>
         Johan Cruyff was a professional footballer and coach from the Netherlands. 
         He won the Ballon d'Or three times as a player, in 1971, 1973, and 1974. Cruyff is 
         generally regarded as being one of the greatest and most influential players in the 
         history of the sport and had been a promoter of the football theory known as Total 
         Football.
       </p><br>
       <p>
         <b>1.</b> Cruyff was almost signed by Leicester City in 1981. Johan was reportedly 
         willing to join manager Jock Wallace at Leicester's Filbert Street stadium, but after 
         three weeks of negotiations, he decided to join the Spanish club Levante then.
       </p><br>
       <p>
         <b>2.</b> In 1987, Cruyff took over as manager of Barcelona. Cruyff already named his 
         cat General Franco, so it was bad news for him. With his relocation to Catalonia, he 
         would have to drastically alter his lifestyle. Regrettably, he changed the unfortunate 
         cat's name to Alfredo di Stefano, oblivious to the fact that it was identical to the 
         former Real Madrid legend.
       </p><br>
       <p>
         <b>3.</b> He didn't play in the 1978 World Cup as he was afraid of leaving his family 
         in the aftermath of a kidnapping attempt, it was recently reported. That was not the 
         case. The competition was held in conjunction with the premiere of the new season of 
         Happy Days, Cruyff's favourite show.
       </p><br>
       <p>
         <b>4.</b> In 2010, the International Astronomical Union (IAU) named a planetoid after 
         Cruyff. ‘He wasn’t only a great football player; he also helped others with his 
         foundation. And that is why he is the first Dutch sports champion to shine in the sky,’ 
         it was said at the time.
       </p><br>
       <p>
         <b>5.</b> The Dutch never lost a match in which Cruyff scored. In 48 appearances for 
         Orange, Johan scored 33 goals.
