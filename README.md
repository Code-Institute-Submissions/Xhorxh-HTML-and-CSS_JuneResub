[View the live project here.](https://xhorxh.github.io/HTML-and-CSS/index.html)

The Flying Dutchman is a site created to hopefully bring together all Johan Cruyff's fans and explore his legacy in different locations. With the help of suggestions from users, this site will be updated every month for upcoming trips. It is designed to be responsive and accessible on a range of devices, making it easy to navigate for potential elderly users and others.

## Features

 __Navigation Bar__
  - Featured on all four pages, the full responsive navigation bar includes links to the Logo on the right side, Home page, Gallery, Sign Up and About Us page and is identical on each page to allow easy navigation.
  - The relevant navigation link is highlighted depending on the section of the page a user is on, meaning a potential elderly user is never confused as to which page they are on.

  ## Testing 
I tested my website all the time while I was writing it(using developer tools in Chrome to see how the elements are placed and with the help of the lessons, I managed to put everything where I wanted to). After adding media queries I had some little problems with the navigation bar and Gallery page. The navigation bar changed on devices with smaller screen resolution and it changed the order of the links, which was fixed by reducing letter-spacing and margin-right of the links. Fixing the Gallery page was a bit challenging because I used a lightbox to present the images and it was overlaying the footer. After some research of documentation, I had to change the heights of list elements for different size screens and that fixed the problem. The website is fully  responsive after lots of tests in [Responsinator](http://www.responsinator.com/?url=https://xhorxh.github.io/HTML-and-CSS/index.html), developer tools and other websites.
